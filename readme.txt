== Description ==

jQuery show / hide collapser for archive description text. Love archive description text for SEO goodness, but don't want it hogging the page. Use this plugin to truncate the text and provide a button to expand the text.

Settings include option to choose how to truncate. For instance how many words or how many lines.

Looking for a helping hand? [View plugin documentation](https://github.com/raisonon/wordpress-category-collapser).
